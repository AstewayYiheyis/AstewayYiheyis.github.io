1) code fragement 1 and 2 are equivalent because having the index and the value(the object) matching the 
selector and then using "e.css()" is the same as just using the keyword "this.css()" to access it.
The third one is a bit different because it specified the index value 

2) $("div").has("ul").css("color", "blue"); //find all divs on a page that include an unordered list in them, and make
their text color be blue

3) $("body").append("<div><h1>JQuery Core</h1></div>");
